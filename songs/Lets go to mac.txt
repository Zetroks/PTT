You know what, catrin? 
I am so sad that i can die. 
I'm fed up, Catrin
We don't have to endure. It's time 

You know there are exist a place
Where food is great and have a taste
Where highschool asshole don't be rude
with those who wearer. Sounds good?

heaven on earth! The shopping center 
If you have money - you can enter
If you have money - you can enter
but know what, Catrin?

Let's go to Mac let's catch a bus
We'll buy some fries for two of us
and crumbs for pigeons and ducks
at nearest river

Let's go to Mac I feel there good
It's better than my neighborhood
There are good smells and tasteful food
don't want to leave it let's go to Mac
